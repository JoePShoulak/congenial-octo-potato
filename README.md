# GOSSIPPYY

## Description

GOSSIPPYY is a social web application meant for simple communication between users. GOSSIPPYY allows users to post to their feed, add other users as friends, and view other user's posts and profiles. User's are required to either log in or create an account through a form submission. After having logged in, user's can then access the homepage where posts and comments can be submitted and viewed. 

The web application features a dynamically updated UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also uses the Bootstrap CSS framework, Express.js, SQL/MySQL Workbench to store user data, handelebars to generate the pages via the server, as well as the TinyMCE javascript library allowing users to add emojis in their posts. 

Our motivation to build GOSSIPPYY was to create a simple and easy way to connect with friends and family as well as spread the latest gossip.

At the top of the page, there is a navigation bar with links to other pages including the homepage, a friends page, the user's profile page, and a "logout" button which brings the user back to the "signin" page. At the bottom of the homepage, the user can view suggested friends with the option to follow them. Additionally, by clicking "all suggestions" the user is redirected to the friends page. 

The friends page features a dynamically formatted list of suggested friends with the option to follow them. 

Lastly, user's can view their profile by clicking the "profile" button in the navigation bar. Once directed to the profile page, user's can view their profile image, name, posts, and friends. When viewing another user's profile, user's also have the option to follow that user by clicking the "follow" button under the user's name.
